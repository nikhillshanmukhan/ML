## Explanation of Preprocessing Steps:

**Loading the Data**: The dataset is loaded directly from sklearn, which ensures we're working with clean, standardized data.

**Data Exploration**:

We examined the dataset structure (8 features, 1 target, 20640 instances)

Checked for missing values (none found in this dataset)

Analyzed basic statistics to understand data distributions

**Train-Test Split**:

Essential for evaluating model performance on unseen data

80-20 split provides sufficient training data while maintaining a good test set size

**Feature Scaling**:

Standardization (subtract mean, divide by std dev) was applied

Necessary because features have different scales (e.g., 'AveRooms' vs 'Latitude')

Especially important for SVR and gradient-based methods

Tree-based methods don't strictly need scaling but we apply for consistency

##  Regression Algorithm Implementation
**Linear Regression**
How it works: Fits a linear equation to the data by minimizing the sum of squared residuals

Suitability: Good baseline model, assumes linear relationship between features and target

**Decision Tree Regressor**
How it works: Recursively splits data based on feature values to minimize variance in target

Suitability: Can capture nonlinear relationships and interactions

**Random Forest Regressor**
How it works: Ensemble of decision trees with bagging (bootstrap aggregating)

Suitability: Handles nonlinear relationships well, robust to outliers

**Gradient Boosting Regressor**
How it works: Sequentially builds trees that correct errors of previous trees

Suitability: Often achieves state-of-the-art performance on tabular data

**Support Vector Regressor**
How it works: Finds a hyperplane in high-dimensional space that best fits the data

Suitability: Effective in high-dimensional spaces, flexible with kernel trick

## Model Performance Analysis
Decision Tree shows clear signs of overfitting

Random Forest emerges as the best performer

Gradient Boosting shows strong performance but slightly worse than Random Forest

Linear Regression performs moderately

SVR underperforms compared to tree-based methods
